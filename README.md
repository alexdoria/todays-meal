Today's Meal

Web app built in Flask with 1 input field form that takes comma separated ingredients you have at home and returns (currently 3) suggestions for meals you can cook with them.

It connects to RapidAPI's Spoonacular API at https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition.

Upcoming improvements coming to the UI.
